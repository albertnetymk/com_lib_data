# Statistics for 2DIDCT on Epiphany

`snake` branch contains the data for snake layout. `auto` means we load all the input data into shared memory once, and run the application 10 times
in a row, which takes about 30 mins. `manual` means we reload all the data on each run, which takes about 180 mins for 10 iterations.
